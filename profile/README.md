## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Rekap research group organization!
Check out our latest projects: https://kapravelos.com/

When creating repository for the project follow these small steps to make it more manageable
1. Reponame should start with project code name (`<codename>-...`). For example `reactions-runner`
2. Repository should have project related specific three tags: (1) `project-<codename>` (2) `<codename>` (3) `<project-id>-<codename>`, where **codename** is original name for the project and **id** is integer found in rekap shared drive. For example: `project-reactions`, `reactions`, `30-reactions`
