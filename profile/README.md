## Hi there 👋

Welcome to Rekap research group organization!
Check out our latest projects: https://kapravelos.com/

When creating repository for the project follow these small steps to make it more manageable
1. Reponame should start with project code name (`<codename>-...`). Codename is the name of the project that matches the folder name on a shared Google Drive. For example `reactions-runner`
2. Try to keep all code into one repository by creating subfolders for each separate group of code
3. Create a README file under the root of the repository, which describes the project and its goals.
