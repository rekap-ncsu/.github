## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to `rekap` research group!
Check out our latest research projects: https://kapravelos.com/

There are should at least two separate repositories for repositories:
1. Repository for the Project's Latex Paper ([latex paper template](https://github.com/rekap-ncsu/paper-template))
2. Repository for the Project's Code

When creating repositories for the project follow these small steps to make it more manageable
1. Repo name should start with project ID followed by codename. Project ID and codename the name of the project that matches the folder name on a shared Google Drive. For example `30-GitHub-Actions`
2. Try to keep all code into one repository by creating subfolders for each separate group of code
3. Create a README file under the root of the repository, which describes the project and its goals.
